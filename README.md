# EditorSplashScreens
 Select your desired splash screen, place the splashs creens bmp image in `{youruprojectpath}\Content\Splash` (make the Splash folder as it likely doesnt already exist) and then, rename the bmp image file to `EdSplash`. When you next launch the uproject, it will use your chosen splash screen during startup.
