# EditorSplashScreens
 Select your desired splash screen, place the bmp image in `{youruprojectpath}\Content\Splash` (make the Splash folder as it likely doesnt already exist) and then, rename the bmp image file to `EdSplash` by removing the additional suffix (eg: `-Bugen`) for your selected image. 
 
 When you next launch the uproject, it will use your chosen splash screen during startup. 
 
 For use within the [FF7R2 UProject](https://github.com/narknon/FF7R2UProj) or similar unreal engine project for FF7 Rebirth
